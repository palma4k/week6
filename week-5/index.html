       <p> My Kids being curious at a view point in Whidbey Island,</p> 
       <p>We love to explore different areas of that Island, and outside that place too.</p>
       <p> My four kids circling around an old marker that is close to a sea wall in whidbey island.</p>
        <p> I chose this image because I liked the background, the sunset, mainly because my four kids are in it.</p>   
       <p> We were also looking over the Horizon</p>
       <p> This picture was also chose becuase I like how the colors blend.</p>
       <p> The sun rays are just perfect in this picture. </p>
       <p> Also, I show everyone How much I LOVE my children, every chance I get.</p>
       <p> Any picture that has my kids in it, is a good picture for me. </p>
