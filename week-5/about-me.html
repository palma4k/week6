        <h2> "My Story" </h2>
        
       <div> <p>I was born in Guatemela, I came to the united states when I was a child. </p>
        
        <P>I grew up in California, in the city of Newhall, county of Los Angeles.</P> 
        
        <P>This city is also considered to be the city of Santa Clarita.</P>
        
        <P>I honestly don't remember anything about Guatemala,</P> 
        
        <P>the last time I was there was back in June 2004,</P> 
        
        <p>for one of my Aunt's funeral. </p> 
        <p>I Haven't been there since then. I've been wanting to go back to visit family, </p>
        
        <p>and all the nice places Guatemala has to offer.</p>
            
        <p>Perhaps next year I will travel there to see how it is.</p> 
        
        <p>I call the United States My Country, My Home, </p>
        
        <p>I've served <em>MY COUNTRY</em> for five years and three months in the <em>UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS.</em> </p> 
        
        <p>Before the Marine Corps, I was in a band that made a CD.</p>
        
        <p>Which allowed us to travel to Peru, Mexico, and places in Southern California.</p>
        
        <p>The instruments I play are; bass, drums, guitar, and keyboard.</p>
        
        <p>I've been to several places, for fun and for business, those are;</p>
       
        <p>Peru, Guatemala, Mexico, Canada, Germany, kurkistan, Afghanistan, Japan, Guam, Wake Island, and Ireland.</p>
        
        <p>Some of those places have some good memories, some don't and others not many.</p>
        
        <p>I had my first set of twins when I was 28 years old</p>
        
        <p>and my second set of twins when I was 30 years old.</p>
        
        <p>Their birthdays are: March 2011, and October 2012. </p>
        
        <p>I know what you might be thinking, I was a busy man, well,</p> 
        
        <p>that's what happens when you are active duty, and come back from a deployment.</p>
