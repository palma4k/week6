       <P>My Kids being curious at a view point in Whidbey Island,
        We love to explore different areas of that Island and outside that place too.
        My four kids are circling around an old marker that is close to a sea wall in whidbey island.
        I chose this image because I liked the background, the sunset, mainly because my four kids are in it.  
        We were also looking over the Horizoz, this picture was also chosen becuase I like how the colors blend.
        The sun rays are just perfect in this picture, also, I enjoy to show everyone How much I LOVE my children, every chance I get.
        Finally, any picture that have my children in it, is a good picture for me. </P>
