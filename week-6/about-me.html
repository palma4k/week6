        <h2> "My Story" </h2>
        
       <div> <p>I was born in Guatemela, I came to the united states when I was a child. 
        I grew up in California, in the city of Newhall, county of Los Angeles.
        This city is also considered to be the city of Santa Clarita.        
        I honestly don't remember anything about Guatemala,
        the last time I was there was back in June 2004,        
        for one of my Aunt's funeral. 
        I Haven't been there since then. I've been wanting to go back to visit family,        
        and all the nice places Guatemala has to offer.            
        Perhaps next year I will travel there to see how it is.        
        I call the <Strong> <em>United States</em>, My Country, My Home,</Strong>
        I've served <em>MY COUNTRY</em> for five years and three months in the <em><Strong>UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS.</Strong></em>   
        Before the Marine Corps, I was in a band that made a CD.
        Which allowed us to travel to Peru, Mexico, and places in Southern California.
        The instruments I play are; bass, drums, guitar, and keyboard.
        I've been to several places, for fun and for business, those are;
        <b>Peru, Guatemala, Mexico, Canada, Germany, kurkistan, Afghanistan, Japan, Guam, Wake Island, and Ireland.</b>
        Some of those places have some good memories, some don't and others not many.        
        I had my first set of twins when I was 28 years old and my second set of twins when I was 30 years old.
        Their birthdays are: March 2011, and October 2012.  
        I know what you might be thinking, I was a busy man, well,
        that's what happens when you are on active duty, and come back from a deployment.</p>
